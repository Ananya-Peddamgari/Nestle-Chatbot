A strong \\nemphasis on nutrition is driving innovation in millet-\\nbased and fortified foods. To remain competitive, brands \\nmust expand their portfolios by integrating science \\nwith nutrition-offering wholesome food options, plant-\\nbased proteins, healthy snacks, and products designed \\nfor healthy aging.\\nSustainability is emerging as a crucial factor in consumer \\ndecision-making. Consumers are increasingly gravitating \\ntoward brands that demonstrate environmental \\nand social responsibility. Companies that prioritize \\nsustainable sourcing, regenerative agricultural practices, \\neco-friendly packaging, carbon footprint reduction, and \\ninvestment in social initiatives are well-positioned to \\ngain a competitive edge in the evolving marketplace.\\nIndia\\u2019s Consumer Landscape: A Market in Transformation\\nIndia\\u2019s FMCG market spans 496 million consumers-35% \\nin urban centers and 65% in villages.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are \\nfurther described in the \\u2018Auditor\\u2019s responsibilities for \\nthe audit of the standalone financial statements\\u2019 section \\nof our report.

We believe that \\nthe audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on \\nthe standalone financial statements.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our \\nprofessional judgment, were of most significance in \\nour audit of the standalone financial statements for the \\nfinancial year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were \\naddressed in the context of our audit of the standalone \\nfinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our \\nopinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate \\nopinion on these matters. For each matter below, our \\ndescription of how our audit addressed the matter is \\nprovided in that context. \\n84\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\\nProvision for contingencies (as described in Note 2, 34 and 40 of the standalone financial statements)\\nManagement is required to make judgments and \\nestimates regarding the issues and exposures arising \\nfrom various matters related to direct tax, indirect tax, \\nclaims, general legal proceedings, and other eventualities \\nthat arise in the regular course of business. The company \\nis also subject to complexities arising from uncertain tax \\npositions concerning the deductibility of expenses.\\nThe key judgment lies in determining the likelihood \\nand magnitude of an unfavourable outcome, as well as \\nthe interpretations of legal aspects, tax legislation, and \\njudgments previously made by authorities. By nature, \\nthese matters are complex and involve many variables.Our audit procedures included the following:\\n\\t We tested the design, implementation and operating \\neffectiveness of key internal controls around the \\nrecognition and measurement of provisions. \\n\\t We inquired the status in respect of significant \\nprovisions with the Company\\u2019s internal tax \\nand legal team.\\n\\t We involved our subject matter experts, wherever \\nrequired, to assess the value of provisions in light of \\nthe nature of the exposures, applicable regulations \\nand related correspondence with the authorities. \\n\\t We assessed reasonability of the assumptions and \\ncritical judgements made by the Company which \\nimpacted their estimate of provision required, \\nconsidering judgements previously made by the \\nauthorities in the relevant jurisdictions or any \\nrelevant opinions given by the Company\\u2019s advisors \\nand assessing whether there was an indication of \\nmanagement bias. We verified the computation of \\nprovision on a test check basis.We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We \\nhave fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor\\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial \\nstatements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance \\nof procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial \\nstatements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, \\nprovide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone financial statements.\\nOther Information \\nThe Company\\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for \\nthe other information. The other information comprises \\nthe information included in the Annual report but does \\nnot include the standalone financial statements and our \\nauditor\\u2019s report thereon.\\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does \\nnot cover the other information and we do not express \\nany form of assurance conclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial \\nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other \\ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether such other \\ninformation is materially inconsistent with the standalone \\nfinancial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the \\naudit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, \\nbased on the work we have performed, we conclude that \\nthere is a material misstatement of this other information, \\nwe are required to report that fact. We have nothing to \\nreport in this regard.Responsibilities of management for the standalone \\nfinancial statements\\nThe Company\\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \\nthe preparation of these standalone financial statements \\nthat give a true and fair view of the financial position, \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive \\nincome, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company \\nin accordance with the accounting principles generally \\naccepted in India, including the Indian Accounting \\nStandards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of \\nthe Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting \\nStandards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility \\nalso includes maintenance of adequate accounting \\nrecords in accordance with the provisions of the Act \\nfor safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for \\npreventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; \\nselection and application of appropriate accounting \\npolicies; making judgments and estimates that are \\nreasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation \\n85\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, \\nthat were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy \\nand completeness of the accounting records, relevant \\nto the preparation and presentation of the standalone \\nfinancial statements that give a true and fair view and \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to \\nfraud or error.\\nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, \\nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Company\\u2019s \\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as \\napplicable, matters related to going concern and using the \\ngoing concern basis of accounting unless management \\neither intends to liquidate the Company or to cease \\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nBoard of Directors are also responsible for overseeing \\nthe Company\\u2019s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor\\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone \\nfinancial statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance \\nabout whether the standalone financial statements as a \\nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due \\nto fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\\u2019s report that \\nincludes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \\nlevel of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect \\na material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements \\ncan arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could \\nreasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone \\nfinancial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n\\t Identify and assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the standalone financial \\nstatements, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those \\nrisks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient \\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement \\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting \\nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, \\nintentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \\noverride of internal control. \\n\\t Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant \\nto the audit in order to design audit procedures that \\nare appropriate in the circumstances. Under section \\n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for \\nexpressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with \\nreference to financial statements in place and the \\noperating effectiveness of such controls.\\n\\t Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting \\npolicies used and the reasonableness of \\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made \\nby management. \\n\\t Conclude on the appropriateness of management\\u2019s \\nuse of the going concern basis of accounting and, \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a \\nmaterial uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the \\nCompany\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. \\nIf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, \\nwe are required to draw attention in our auditor\\u2019s \\nreport to the related disclosures in the financial \\nstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, \\nto modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based \\non the audit evidence obtained up to the date of \\nour auditor\\u2019s report. However, future events or \\nconditions may cause the Company to cease to \\ncontinue as a going concern. \\n\\t Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and \\ncontent of the standalone financial statements, \\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the \\nstandalone financial statements represent the \\nunderlying transactions and events in a manner \\nthat achieves fair presentation. \\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope \\nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, \\nincluding any significant deficiencies in internal control \\nthat we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with \\na statement that we have complied with relevant \\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to \\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged \\nwith governance, we determine those matters that \\nwere of most significance in the audit of the standalone \\nfinancial statements for the financial year ended March \\n31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit matters. We \\ndescribe these matters in our auditor\\u2019s report unless \\nlaw or regulation precludes public disclosure about the \\nmatter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we \\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in \\nour report because the adverse consequences of doing \\nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \\ninterest benefits of such communication.\\n86\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n1.

The Company has been incorporated in \\n1959 under the provisions of Indian Companies Act and its equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited and NSE \\nLimited in India. The Company is primarily involved in Food business which incorporates product groups viz. Milk \\nProducts and Nutrition, Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids, Powdered and Liquid Beverages and Confectionery.\\n2  MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n Material accounting policies used in preparation of the standalone financial statements have generally been \\nincluded in the relevant notes to the financial statements.\\n A  BASIS OF PREPARATION AND MEASUREMENT \\n  a  Statement of Compliance\\n   The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in compliance with all material aspects \\nof the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 \\nand presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.\\n  b  Basis of Measurement\\n   The financial statements have been prepared on accrual and going concern basis under the historical \\ncost convention except for certain class of financial assets/ liabilities, share based payments and net \\nliability for defined benefit plans that are measured at fair value. The accounting policies have been \\nconsistently applied by the Company unless stated otherwise.\\n  c  Financial Year\\n   The Company had opted the period of 1st day of January to 31st day of December, each year as its \\nfinancial year for the purpose of preparation of financial statements under the provisions of Section \\n2(41) of the Companies Act, 2013, which the Company Law Board had allowed.\\n   The Board of Directors on 27th July 2023 have approved the change of financial year of the Company to \\nuniform financial year commencing on 1st April of every year and ending on 31st March of the following \\nyear. Consequently, as a transitional arrangement, the previous financial year of the Company was for a \\nperiod of 15 months from 1st January 2023 to 31st March 2024 and hence the figures are not comparable \\nwith the current financial year which comprised of twelve months.\\n  d  Functional and Presentation Currency\\n   The financial statements have been prepared and presented in Indian Rupees (H), which is also the \\nCompany\\u2019s functional currency. \\n  e  Rounding Off\\n   All amounts in the financial statement and accompanying notes are presented in H million and have \\nbeen rounded-off to one decimal place unless stated otherwise.\\n  f  Current and Non-current Classification\\n   The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current / non-current \\nclassification of assets and liabilities. This is based on the nature of products and the time between \\nacquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.\\n  g  Measurement of Profit from Operations\\n   For better understanding of the financial performance, the Company has chosen to present Profit from \\nOperations as an additional information in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Profit from Operations is \\nderived from Profit before Exceptional Items & Tax less Other Income and adding back Finance Costs \\n(Including Interest Cost on Employee Benefit Plans) and Corporate Social Responsibility Expense.\\n105\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25NOTES FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025  h  Use of Estimates and Judgement\\n   The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement and make \\nestimates and assumptions that affects the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and \\nliabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other \\nfactors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these \\nestimates. These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to \\naccounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known/materialise.\\n   The areas involving significant estimates and judgement include determination of useful life of property, \\nplant and equipment (Refer note 6), measurement of lease liabilities and right of use assets (Refer note 6), \\nmeasurement of defined benefit obligations (Refer note 32), recognition and measurement of provisions \\nand contingencies (Refer note 34) and recognition of deferred tax assets / liabilities (Refer note 36).\\n  i  Approval of Financial Statements\\n   The financial statements of the Company for the period ended 31st March 2025 were approved for issue \\nby the Board of Directors on 24th April 2025.\\n B FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\\n  Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded in the functional currency i.e. Indian Rupees (H) using \\nthe exchange rate at the date of transaction.\\n  Monetary items (i.e. receivables, payables) denominated in foreign currency are reported using the closing \\nexchange rate as on each balance sheet date.\\n  The exchange difference arising on the settlement or reporting of monetary items at rates different from \\nrates at which these were initially recorded / reported in previous financial statements, are recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.\\n  Also refer to accounting policy on \\u2018Derivatives and Hedge accounting\\u2019. (Refer note 37)\\n C PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\\n  Provisions for Contingencies/ Contingent liabilities are recognised/disclosed after evaluation of facts and legal \\naspects of the matter involved, in line with Ind AS 37- Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets \\nand Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes. Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal/\\nconstructive) and on management judgement as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that a cash outflow \\nwill be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at \\nthe best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the Balance Sheet date.\\n  A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that \\nmay, but probably will not require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present \\nobligation in respect of which likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.\\n  Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements since this may result in the recognition of \\nincome that may never be accrued/ realised.\\n D BORROWING COSTS \\n  Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of qualifying assets (i.e. assets which \\ntake substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use) are capitalised as part of the cost of that \\nasset. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the \\nperiod in which they are incurred. \\n E  EARNINGS PER SHARE\\n  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity \\nshareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the \\npurpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity \\nshareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for \\nthe effects of all dilutive potential equity shares, if any.\\n106\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedNOTES FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025  On and from the Record Date of 5th January 2024, the equity shares of the Company have been sub- divided, \\nsuch that 1 (one) equity share having face value of H10/- (H ten only) each, fully paid-up, stands sub-divided \\ninto 10 (ten) equity shares having face value of H1/- (H one only) each, fully paid-up, ranking pari-passu  in \\nall respects.

Accordingly, depreciation has been computed on useful lives based on technical evaluation of relevant class \\nof assets including components thereof. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. Depreciation is provided \\nas per the straight line method computed basis useful lives of property, plant and equipment as follows:\\nCategory Useful Life \\nLeased Assets Over the period of lease or useful life, whichever is lower \\nBuildings 25-40 years \\nPlant & Equipment 5- 25 years\\nOffice Equipment 5 years\\nFurniture and Fixtures 5 years\\nVehicles 5 years\\nInformation Technology (IT) equipment 3-5 years\\n Freehold land is not depreciated.\\n Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment\\n At each balance sheet date, the company reviews whether there is any indication that an item of property, plant \\nand equipment including capital work in progress, right of use assets or intangible assets (asset / cash generating \\nunit) may be impaired. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the levels for which there \\nare separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating unit). If any impairment indicator exists, estimate of the \\nrecoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment /cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is \\nmade. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss whenever the carrying amount of \\nan asset/ cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted \\nto their present value based on an appropriate discount rate.\\n Reversal of impairment losses recognised in earlier years is recorded when there is an indication that the \\nimpairment losses recognised for the asset/cash generating unit no longer exist or have decreased. However, the \\nincrease in carrying amount of an asset due to reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does \\nnot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss \\nbeen recognised for that asset/cash generating unit in earlier years.\\n108\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedNOTES FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025 Property, Plant and Equipment - Right of Use Assets\\n The company\\u2019s leases mainly comprises of land, buildings, plant & machinery and vehicles. The company leases \\nland and buildings primarily for offices, manufacturing facilities and warehouses. \\n The Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or \\ncontains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in \\nexchange for consideration.\\n At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognises a right-of-use asset (\\u201cROU\\u201d) and a \\ncorresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee.\\n The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability \\nadjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct \\ncosts less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line \\nbasis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the underlying asset.\\n The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental \\nborrowing rates. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect \\ninterest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. A lease liability is \\nremeasured upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in the lease term or a change in an index or rate \\nused to determine lease payments with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of Right-of-use assets.\\n Lease liability and Right-of-use assets are separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments are \\nclassified as financing cash flows in the Cash Flow Statement.\\n The company recognizes lease payments as other expense on a straight line basis over the period of lease for \\nshort term leases or leases of low value assets.\\n(J in million)\\nParticulars Gross Carrying Value  Depreciation/ Amortisation  Net \\nCarrying \\nValue \\nCost as at  \\n31st March \\n2024Additions  Deletions / \\nAdjustments Cost as at  \\n31st March \\n2025As at  \\n31st March \\n2024For the year  Impairment \\nloss  On \\ndeletions / \\nAdjustments As at  \\n31st March \\n2025As at  \\n31st March \\n2025\\n6A.

All financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition \\nexcept trade receivables which are initially recognised at transaction price as they do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component. Transaction costs in relation to financial assets and financial liabilities, other than \\nthose carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are added to the fair value on initial recognition. \\nTransaction costs in relation to financial assets and financial liabilities which are carried at fair value through \\nprofit or loss (FVTPL), are charged to the statement of profit and loss.\\n b) CLASSIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\\n  For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified as follows:\\n  Amortised cost - Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset \\nin order to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost less impairment, if any. Interest income calculated using effective interest rate \\n(EIR) method and impairment loss, if any are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - Financial assets that are held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by both holding the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows \\nthat are solely payments of principal and interest and by selling the financial assets, are subsequently \\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value are recognized in the \\nother comprehensive income (OCI) and on derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised \\nin OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest income calculated using EIR method and \\nimpairment loss, if any are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above \\ncategories are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in fair value and income \\non these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n c) CLASSIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\\n  For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified as follows:\\n  Amortised cost - Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost by default. Interest \\nexpense calculated using EIR method is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. \\n  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL if it is held for trading, \\nor is designated as such on initial recognition. Changes in fair value and interest expense on these liabilities \\nare recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n132\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedNOTES FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025 d) DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\\n  The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset \\nexpire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows including risks and rewards of ownership.  \\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or expires.\\n e) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\\n  Financial assets (debt instruments) that are carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome (FVOCI) are assessed for possible impairments basis expected credit losses taking into account the past \\nhistory of recovery, risk of default of the counterparty, existing market conditions etc. The impairment methodology \\napplied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.  \\n  For Trade receivables, the Company provides for expected credit losses based on a simplified approach as \\nper Ind AS 109 \\u2013 Financial Instruments. Under this approach, expected credit losses are computed basis the \\nprobability of defaults over the lifetime of the asset.\\n f) DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\\n  Derivative instruments used by the company include forward contracts. The Company formally establishes \\na hedge relationship between such forward contracts (\\u2018hedging instrument\\u2019) and recognized financial asset/\\nliabilities (\\u2018hedged item\\u2019) through a formal documentation at the inception of the hedge. Forward contracts \\nare designated as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (fair \\nvalue hedges) and against highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). The effectiveness of \\nhedge instruments is assessed at the inception and on an ongoing basis.\\n  Derivatives instruments such as forward contracts are initially measured at fair value. When a forward \\ncontract is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of change in the fair value of the contract \\nis recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity under \\u201ceffective portion \\nof cash flow hedges\\u201d. Amount recognised in other equity is subsequently reclassified to the statement of \\nprofit and loss upon occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. Any ineffective portion of the change \\nin the fair value of the contract is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. \\n  Changes in fair value of forward contracts designated as fair value hedge are recognised in the statement of \\nprofit and loss.\\n g) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\\n  Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is normally determined by references to the transaction price \\nor market price. If the fair value is not reliably determinable, the company determines the fair value using \\nvaluation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available, \\nmaximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\\n h) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY CATEGORY\\n(J in million)\\nParticulars NoteAs at  \\n31st March, 2025  As at  \\n31st March, 2024 \\nFinancial Assets \\n(i)Measured at Amortised Cost \\nInvestments \\nLong Term Tax free Bonds 7  -  4,238.9 \\nTreasury Bills - Government Securities 7  -  399.8 \\nTrade receivables 13  3,631.5  3,004.6 \\nCash and cash equivalents 14  761.8  7,588.7 \\nBank Balances other than cash and cash equivalents 15  194.7  199.8 \\nLoans 8  184.0  190.2 \\nOther financial assets 9  777.8  1,023.0 \\n 5,549.8  16,645.0 \\n133\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25NOTES FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025(J in million)\\nParticulars NoteAs at  \\n31st March, 2025  As at  \\n31st March, 2024 \\n(ii)Measured at Fair Value through Profit & Loss \\nInvestment in Mutual Funds 7  -  - \\nDerivative assets - forward contracts 9  23.4  4.8 \\n 23.4  4.8 \\nTotal Financial Assets (i+ii)  5,573.2  16,649.8 \\nFinancial Liabilities \\n(i)Measured at Amortised Cost \\nBorrowings 18  7,533.4  311.4 \\nLease liabilities 19  4,135.1  3,133.9 \\nTrade payables 22  23,735.3  22,378.9 \\nPayables for capital expenditure  2,502.8  5,741.2 \\nOthers financial liabilities 23  7,525.0  6,411.9 \\n 45,431.6  37,977.3 \\n(ii)Measured at Fair Value through Profit & Loss \\nDerivative liabilities - forward contracts 23  28.0  5.3 \\n 28.0  5.3 \\nTotal Financial Liabilities (i+ii)  45,459.6  37,982.6 \\n(i)Financial assets/liabilities at amortised cost \\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and financial \\nliabilities measured at amortised cost are a reasonable \\napproximation of their fair values except Investments for \\nwhich the fair value are as follows:\\nFair value of Investments measured at amortised cost (Level 1)  -  4,888.5 \\n(ii)Financial assets at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income \\nInvestment in Equity Shares (Level 3)  -  - \\n(iii)Financial assets at fair value through profit & loss \\nInvestment in Mutual Funds (Level 1)  -  - \\nDerivative assets - forward contracts (Level 2)  23.4  4.8 \\n(iv)Financial liabilities at fair value through profit & loss \\nDerivative liabilities - forward contracts (Level 2)  28.0  5.3  i) FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\\n  The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments on the basis of the following hierarchy:\\n  Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets are determined on the basis \\nof quoted price for identical assets or liabilities.\\n  Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined using \\nvaluation techniques based on observable market data.\\n  Level 3: The fair value of financial instruments that are measured on the basis of entity specific valuations \\nusing inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The holding company is also \\nsubject to complexities arising from uncertain tax positions \\nconcerning the deductibility of expenses.\\nThe key judgment lies in determining the likelihood and \\nmagnitude of an unfavourable outcome, as well as the \\ninterpretations of legal aspects, tax legislation, and judgments \\npreviously made by authorities. By nature, these matters are \\ncomplex and involve many variables.Our audit procedures included the following:\\n\\t We tested the design and operating effectiveness \\nof key internal controls around the recognition and \\nmeasurement of provisions. \\n\\t We inquired the status in respect of significant provisions \\nwith the Holding Company\\u2019s internal tax and legal team.\\n\\t We involved our subject matter experts, wherever \\nrequired, to assess the value of provisions in light of \\nthe nature of the exposures, applicable regulations and \\nrelated correspondence with the authorities. \\n\\t  We assessed reasonability of the assumptions and \\ncritical judgements made by the Holding Company which \\nimpacted their estimate of provision required, considering \\njudgements previously made by the authorities in the \\nrelevant jurisdictions or any relevant opinions given by \\nthe Holding Company\\u2019s advisors and assessing whether \\nthere was an indication of management bias. We verified \\nthe computation of provision on a test check basis.opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For matter below, our description of how \\nour audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. \\nWe have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We \\nhave fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor\\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements section of our report, including in relation to this matter. \\nAccordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks \\nof material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures including the \\nprocedures performed to address the matter below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying \\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nOther Information \\nThe Holding Company\\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible \\nfor the other information. The other information \\ncomprises the information included in the Annual \\nreport, but does not include the consolidated financial \\nstatements and our auditor\\u2019s report thereon.\\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements \\ndoes not cover the other information and we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other information \\nand, in doing so, consider whether such other information \\nis materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial \\nstatements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or \\notherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the \\nwork we have performed, we conclude that there is a material \\nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to \\nreport that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\nThe Holding Company\\u2019s Board of Directors is \\nresponsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in terms of the \\nrequirements of the Act that give a true and fair view \\nof the consolidated financial position, consolidated \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive \\nincome, consolidated cash flows and consolidated \\nstatement of changes in equity of the Holding Company \\nand its Associate in accordance with the accounting \\nprinciples generally accepted in India, including the \\nIndian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under \\nsection 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian \\nAccounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The \\nrespective Board of Directors of the Holding Company \\nand its Associate are responsible for maintenance of \\nadequate accounting records in accordance with the \\nprovisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their \\nrespective companies and for preventing and detecting \\nfrauds and other irregularities; selection and application \\nof appropriate accounting policies; making judgments \\nand estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the \\ndesign, implementation and maintenance of adequate \\ninternal financial controls, that were operating effectively \\nfor ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the \\naccounting records, relevant to the preparation and \\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements \\nthat give a true and fair view and are free from material \\n150\\nNestl\\u00e9 India Limitedmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which \\nhave been used for the purpose of preparation of the \\nconsolidated financial statements by the Directors of the \\nHolding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the \\nrespective Board of Directors of the Holding Company \\nand its Associate are responsible for assessing the \\nability of their respective companies to continue as a \\ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related \\nto going concern and using the going concern basis of \\naccounting unless management either intends to liquidate \\nthe Holding Company and its Associate or to cease \\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors of the Holding \\nCompany and its Associate are also responsible for \\noverseeing the financial reporting process of their \\nrespective companies.\\nAuditor\\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a \\nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due \\nto fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\\u2019s report that \\nincludes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \\nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can \\narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, \\nindividually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably \\nbe expected to influence the economic decisions \\nof users taken on the basis of these consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n\\t Identify and assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial \\nstatements, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those \\nrisks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient \\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement \\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting \\nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, \\nintentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \\noverride of internal control. \\n\\t Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant \\nto the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under \\nsection 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible \\nfor expressing our opinion on whether the Holding \\nCompany has adequate internal financial controls \\nwith reference to financial statements in place and \\nthe operating effectiveness of such controls.\\t Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies \\nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \\nand related disclosures made by management. \\n\\t Conclude on the appropriateness of management\\u2019s \\nuse of the going concern basis of accounting and, \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a \\nmaterial uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the \\nability of the Holding Company and its Associate to \\ncontinue as a going concern. If we conclude that \\na material uncertainty exists, we are required to \\ndraw attention in our auditor\\u2019s report to the related \\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our \\nopinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit \\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\\u2019s \\nreport. However, future events or conditions may \\ncause the Holding Company and its Associate to \\ncease to continue as a going concern. \\n\\t Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and \\ncontent of the consolidated financial statements, \\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the \\nunderlying transactions and events in a manner \\nthat achieves fair presentation. \\n\\t Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence \\nregarding the financial information of the Holding \\nCompany of which we are the independent \\nauditor and whose financial information we have \\naudited, to express an opinion on the consolidated \\nfinancial statements. \\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of \\nthe Holding Company of which we are the independent \\nauditor regarding, among other matters, the planned \\nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit \\nfindings, including any significant deficiencies in internal \\ncontrol that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with \\na statement that we have complied with relevant \\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to \\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged \\nwith governance, we determine those matters that were \\nof most significance in the audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements for the financial year ended March \\n31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit matters. We \\ndescribe these matters in our auditor\\u2019s report unless \\nlaw or regulation precludes public disclosure about the \\nmatter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we \\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in \\nour report because the adverse consequences of doing \\nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \\ninterest benefits of such communication.\\n151\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n1.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the \\nGuidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls \\nOver Financial Reporting (the \\u201cGuidance Note\\u201d) and \\nthe Standards on Auditing, specified under section \\n143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of \\ninternal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those \\nStandards and the Guidance Note require that we \\ncomply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nadequate internal financial controls with reference to \\nconsolidated financial statements was established and \\nmaintained and if such controls operated effectively in \\nall material respects.\\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain \\naudit evidence about the adequacy of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements included obtaining an understanding \\nof internal financial controls with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements, assessing the risk that a material \\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design \\nand operating effectiveness of internal control based on \\nthe assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on \\nthe auditor\\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the \\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, \\nwhether due to fraud or error. \\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit \\nopinion on the internal financial controls with reference \\nto consolidated financial statements.\\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference \\nto Consolidated Financial Statements\\nA company's internal financial control with reference to \\nconsolidated financial statements is a process designed \\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial \\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company's \\ninternal financial control with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements includes those policies and \\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly \\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets \\nof the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \\npreparation of financial statements in accordance \\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and \\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are \\nbeing made only in accordance with authorisations of \\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) \\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or \\ntimely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company's assets that could have a \\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\\n154\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls \\nwith reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements, including the possibility of collusion or \\nimproper management override of controls, material \\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not \\nbe detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements to future periods are subject to the \\nrisk that the internal financial controls with reference \\nto consolidated financial statements may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures \\nmay deteriorate.\\nOpinion\\nIn our opinion, the Holding Company, has maintained in all \\nmaterial respects, adequate internal financial controls with \\nreference to consolidated financial statements and such \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements were operating effectively as at \\nMarch 31,2025, based on the internal control over financial \\nreporting criteria established by the Holding Company \\nconsidering the essential components of internal control \\nstated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\\nFor S.R.

The Company has been incorporated in \\n1959 under the provisions of Indian Companies Act and its equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited and NSE \\nLimited in India. The Company is primarily involved in Food business which incorporates product groups viz. Milk \\nProducts and Nutrition, Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids, Powdered and Liquid Beverages and Confectionery.\\n The consolidated financial statements comprise financial statements of Nestl\\u00e9 India Limited and its associate \\nDr. Reddy's and Nestl\\u00e9 Health Science Limited (collectively, the \\u2018Company\\u2019) for the year ended 31st March 2025.\\n The consolidated financial statements of the Company includes 49% interest in Dr. Reddy's and Nestle Health \\nScience Limited as an associate, consolidated in accordance with Ind AS 28 - Investment in Associates and \\nJoint Ventures.\\n2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n Material accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements have generally been \\nincluded in the relevant notes to the financial statements.\\n A BASIS OF PREPARATION AND MEASUREMENT \\n  a Statement of Compliance\\n   The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in compliance with all \\nmaterial aspects of the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified under Section 133 \\nof the Companies Act, 2013 and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the \\nCompanies Act, 2013.\\n  b Investment in Associates\\n   An associate is an entity over which the Company is in a position to exercise significant influence over \\noperating and financial policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and \\noperating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. Goodwill \\narising on the acquisition of associates is included in the carrying value of investments in associates.\\n   The Company's investments in its associate is accounted for using the equity method. Under the \\nequity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the \\ninvestment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Company\\u2019s share of net assets of the associate since \\nthe acquisition date. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\\u2019s share of profits or \\nlosses, other comprehensive income and equity movements, from the date that significant influence \\ncommences. When the Company\\u2019s share of losses exceeds the carrying value of such investments, the \\ncarrying value is reduced to Nil and recognition of future losses is discontinued, except to the extent \\nthat the Company has incurred obligation in respect of the associate. Unrealised gains and losses \\nresulting from transactions between the parent Company and the associate are eliminated to the \\nextent of the interest in the associate. After application of the equity method, if indication of impairment \\nexists the carrying amount of Investment is assessed and written down to its recoverable amount.\\n   The financial statements of the associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company \\nto enable consolidation of  the financial information of the associates. \\n  c Basis of Measurement\\n   The financial statements have been prepared on accrual and going concern basis under the historical \\ncost convention except for certain class of financial assets/ liabilities, share based payments and net \\nliability for defined benefit plans that are measured at fair value. The accounting policies have been \\nconsistently applied by the Company unless stated otherwise.\\n163\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25NOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025  d Financial Year\\n   The Company had opted the period of 1st day of January to 31st day of December, each year as its \\nfinancial year for the purpose of preparation of financial statements under the provisions of Section \\n2(41) of the Companies Act, 2013, which the Company Law Board had allowed.\\n   The Board of Directors on 27th July 2023  have approved the change of financial year of the Company to \\nuniform financial year commencing on 1st April of every year and ending on 31st March of the following \\nyear. Consequently, as a transitional arrangement, the previous financial year of the Company was for a \\nperiod of 15 months from 1st January 2023 to 31st March 2024 and hence the figures are not comparable \\nwith the current financial year which comprised of twelve months.\\n  e  Functional and Presentation Currency\\n   The financial statements have been prepared and presented in Indian Rupees (H), which is also the \\nCompany\\u2019s functional currency. \\n  f  Rounding Off\\n   All amounts in the financial statement and accompanying notes are presented in H million and have \\nbeen rounded-off to one decimal place unless stated otherwise.\\n  g  Current and Non-current Classification\\n   The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current / non-current \\nclassification of assets and liabilities. This is based on the nature of products and the time between \\nacquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.\\n  h Measurement of Profit from Operations\\n   For better understanding of the financial performance, the Company has chosen to present Profit from \\nOperations as an additional information in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Profit from Operations is \\nderived from Profit before Exceptional Items & Tax less Other Income and adding back Finance Costs \\n(Including Interest Cost on Employee Benefit Plans) and Corporate Social Responsibility Expense.\\n  i  Use of Estimates and Judgement\\n   The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement and make \\nestimates and assumptions that affects the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and \\nliabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other \\nfactors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these \\nestimates. These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to \\naccounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known/materialise.\\n   The areas involving significant estimates and judgement include determination of useful life of property, \\nplant and equipment (Refer note 6), measurement of lease liabilities and right of use assets (Refer \\nnote 6), measurement of defined benefit obligations (Refer note 32), recognition and measurement \\nof provisions and contingencies (Refer note 34) and recognition of deferred tax assets / liabilities \\n(Refer note 36).\\n  j Approval of Financial Statements\\n   The financial statements of the Company for the period ended 31st March 2025 were approved for issue \\nby the Board of Directors on 24th April 2025.\\n B FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\\n  Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded in the functional currency i.e. Indian Rupees (H) using \\nthe exchange rate at the date of transaction.\\n  Monetary items (i.e. receivables, payables) denominated in foreign currency are reported using the closing \\nexchange rate as on each balance sheet date.\\n164\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedNOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025  The exchange difference arising on the settlement or reporting of monetary items at rates different from \\nrates at which these were initially recorded / reported in previous financial statements, are recognised in the \\nstatement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.\\n  Also refer to accounting policy on \\u2018Derivatives and Hedge accounting\\u2019. (Refer note 37)\\n C PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\\n  Provisions for Contingencies/ Contingent liabilities are recognised/disclosed after evaluation of facts and \\nlegal aspects of the matter involved, in line with Ind AS 37- Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent \\nAssets and Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes. Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation \\n(legal/constructive) and on management judgement as a result of a past event, for which it is probable \\nthat a cash outflow will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. \\nProvisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at \\nthe Balance Sheet date.\\n  A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that \\nmay, but probably will not require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present \\nobligation in respect of which likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.\\n  Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements since this may result in the recognition of \\nincome that may never be accrued/ realised.\\n D  BORROWING COSTS\\n  Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of qualifying assets (i.e. assets which \\ntake substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use) are capitalised as part of the cost of that \\nasset. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the \\nperiod in which they are incurred.\\n E EARNINGS PER SHARE\\n  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity \\nshareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the \\npurpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity \\nshareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for \\nthe effects of all dilutive potential equity shares, if any.\\n  On and from the Record Date of 5th January 2024, the equity shares of the Company have been sub- divided, \\nsuch that 1 (one) equity share having face value of H10/- (H ten only) each, fully paid-up, stands sub-divided \\ninto 10 (ten) equity shares having face value of H1/- (H one only) each, fully paid-up, ranking pari-passu  in \\nall respects. The Earnings per Share for the prior periods have been restated considering the face value of \\nH1/- each in accordance with Ind AS 33 - Earnings per Share.\\n F EVENTS OCCURING AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE\\n  All material events occurring after the balance sheet date upto the date of approval of financial statements \\nby the Board of Directors on 24th April 2025, have been considered, disclosed and adjusted, wherever \\napplicable, as per the requirements of Ind AS 10 - Events after the Reporting Period.\\n3 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\\n The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has notified amendments to the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \\nRules, 2015, vide notification number G.S.R. 492 (E) dated 12th August, 2024, G.S.R. 554(E) dated 9th September, \\n165\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25NOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 20252024 and G.S.R. 602(E) dated 28th September, 2024.

Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. \\nDepreciation is provided as per the straight line method computed basis useful lives of property, plant and \\nequipment as follows:\\n Freehold land is not depreciated.\\n Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment\\n At each balance sheet date, the company reviews whether there is any indication that an item of property, plant \\nand equipment including capital work in progress, right of use assets or intangible assets (asset / cash generating \\nunit) may be impaired. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the levels for which there \\nare separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating unit).

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss whenever the carrying amount of \\nan asset/ cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted \\nto their present value based on an appropriate discount rate.\\n Reversal of impairment losses recognised in earlier years is recorded when there is an indication that the \\nimpairment losses recognised for the asset/cash generating unit no longer exist or have decreased.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line \\nbasis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the underlying asset.\\n The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental \\nborrowing rates.

All financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition \\nexcept trade receivables which are initially recognised at transaction price as they do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component. Transaction costs in relation to financial assets and financial liabilities, other than \\nthose carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are added to the fair value on initial recognition. \\nTransaction costs in relation to financial assets and financial liabilities which are carried at fair value through \\nprofit or loss (FVTPL), are charged to the statement of profit and loss.\\n b) CLASSIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\\n  For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified as follows: \\n  Amortised cost - Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset \\nin order to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost less impairment, if any. Interest income calculated using effective interest rate \\n(EIR) method and impairment loss, if any are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - Financial assets that are held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by both holding the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows \\nthat are solely payments of principal and interest and by selling the financial assets, are subsequently \\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value are recognized in the \\nother comprehensive income (OCI) and on derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised \\nin OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest income calculated using EIR method and \\nimpairment loss, if any are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. \\n  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above \\ncategories are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in fair value and income \\non these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n c) CLASSIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\\n  For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified as follows:\\n  Amortised cost - Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost by default. Interest \\nexpense calculated using EIR method is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. \\n  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL if it is held for trading, \\nor is designated as such on initial recognition. Changes in fair value and interest expense on these liabilities \\nare recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n d) DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\\n  The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial  \\nasset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows including risks and rewards  \\n of ownership. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or expires.\\n e) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\\n  Financial assets (debt instruments) that are carried at amortised cost and fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income (FVOCI) are assessed for possible impairments basis expected credit losses taking \\ninto account the past history of recovery, risk of default of the counterparty, existing market conditions etc. \\nThe impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit \\nrisk since initial recognition. \\n  For Trade receivables, the Company provides for expected credit losses based on a simplified approach as \\nper Ind AS 109 \\u2013 Financial Instruments.  Under this approach, expected credit losses are computed basis the \\nprobability of defaults over the lifetime of the asset.\\n192\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedNOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025(J in million)\\nParticulars NoteAs at  \\n31st March, 2025  As at  \\n31st March, 2024 \\nFinancial Assets \\n(i)Measured at Amortised Cost \\nInvestments \\nLong Term Tax free Bonds  7  -    4,238.9 \\nTreasury Bills - Government Securities 7  -    399.8 \\nTrade receivables 13  3,631.5  3,004.6 \\nCash and cash equivalents 14  761.8  7,588.7 \\nBank Balances other than cash and cash equivalents 15  194.7  199.8 \\nLoans 8  184.0  190.2 \\nOther financial assets 9  777.8  1,023.0 \\n 5,549.8  16,645.0 \\n(ii)Measured at Fair Value through Profit & Loss \\nInvestment in Mutual Funds 7  -    -   \\nDerivative assets - forward contracts 9  23.4  4.8 \\n 23.4  4.8 \\nTotal Financial Assets (i+ii)  5,573.2  16,649.8  f) DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\\n  Derivative instruments used by the company include forward contracts. The Company formally establishes \\na hedge relationship between such forward contracts (\\u2018hedging instrument\\u2019) and recognized financial asset/\\nliabilities (\\u2018hedged item\\u2019) through a formal documentation at the inception of the hedge. Forward contracts \\nare designated as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (fair \\nvalue hedges) and against highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). The effectiveness of \\nhedge instruments is assessed at the inception and on an ongoing basis.\\n  Derivatives instruments such as forward contracts are initially measured at fair value. When a forward \\ncontract is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of change in the fair value of the contract \\nis recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity under \\u201ceffective portion \\nof cash flow hedges\\u201d. Amount recognised in other equity is subsequently reclassified to the statement of \\nprofit and loss upon occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. Any ineffective portion of the change \\nin the fair value of the contract is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. \\n  Changes in fair value of forward contracts designated as fair value hedge are recognised in the statement of \\nprofit and loss.\\n g) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\\n  Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is normally determined by references to the transaction price \\nor market price. If the fair value is not reliably determinable, the company determines the fair value using \\nvaluation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available, \\nmaximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\\n h) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY CATEGORY\\n193\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25NOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st MARCH, 2025(i)Financial assets/liabilities at amortised cost \\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and financial \\nliabilities measured at amortised cost are a reasonable \\napproximation of their fair values except Investments for \\nwhich the fair value are as follows:\\nFair value of Investments measured at amortised cost (Level 1)  -    4,888.5 \\n(ii)Financial assets at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income \\nInvestment in Equity Shares (Level 3)  -    -   \\n(iii)Financial assets at fair value through profit & loss  \\nInvestment in Mutual Funds (Level 1)  -    -   \\nDerivative assets - forward contracts (Level 2)  23.4  4.8 \\n(iv)Financial liabilities at fair value through profit & loss \\nDerivative liabilities - forward contracts (Level 2)  28.0  5.3 (J in million)\\nParticulars NoteAs at  \\n31st March, 2025  As at  \\n31st March, 2024 \\nFinancial Liabilities \\n(i)Measured at Amortised Cost \\nBorrowings 18  7,533.4  311.4 \\nLease liabilities 19  4,135.1  3,133.9 \\nTrade payables 22  23,735.3  22,378.9 \\nPayables for capital expenditure  2,502.8  5,741.2 \\nOthers financial liabilities 23  7,525.0  6,036.6 \\n 45,431.6  37,602.0 \\n(ii)Measured at Fair Value through Profit & Loss \\nDerivative liabilities - forward contracts 23  28.0  5.3 \\n 28.0  5.3 \\nTotal Financial Liabilities (i+ii)  45,459.6  37,607.3 \\n i) FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\\n  The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments on the basis of the following hierarchy:\\n  Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets are determined on the basis \\nof quoted price for identical assets or liabilities.\\n  Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined using \\nvaluation techniques based on observable market data.\\n  Level 3: The fair value of financial instruments that are measured on the basis of entity specific valuations \\nusing inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY\\n(a) Steps taken or impact on conservation of energy:\\n Your Company continued to accelerate its sustainability efforts during the financial year ended 31st March 2025, \\neven though it was challenging year. Keeping people safe and ensuring consumers have access to the \\nCompany\\u2019s foods and beverages has remained central to your Company\\u2019s activities across the country. As part of  \\nlong-term sustainability, your Company ensures that the products, packaging and operations are safe for \\nemployees, consumers and the environment. Your Company ensures this with a focus on technologies, processes \\nand improvements that matter for the environment. At Nestl\\u00e9, sustainability inspires and guides everything your \\nCompany does. Moreover, your Company gives highest priority to ensure environmental friendly practices at all \\nfactories and offices. These include reduction in power consumption, optimal water consumption, switching to \\ngreen energy, eliminating excess use of paper and using eco-friendly products.\\n As in the past, your Company continued to stress upon measures for the conservation and optimal utilisation \\nof energy in all the areas of operations, including those for energy generation and effective usage of  \\nsources/ equipment used for generation. Within your Company, there are continuous efforts towards improving \\noperational efficiencies, minimizing consumption of natural resources and reducing water, energy & CO2 \\nemissions while maximizing production volumes.\\n Your Company achieved 100% renewable electricity, including International Renewable Electricity Certificates \\n(I-RECs). These efforts reflect your Company\\u2019s commitment to decarbonizing operations and transitioning to a \\nlow emission future. Key initiatives included flash steam heat recovery from condensate, automation of boiler & \\nair heater burners, optimization of compressed air consumption, steam usage optimization in coffee and noodle \\nprocesses, and the use of Electronically Commutated (EC+) Blowers in Air Handling Units (AHUs).\\n Your Company has installed biomass boilers in Moga, Nanjangud and Sanand to reduce its operational footprint \\nand increasingly use renewable fuel in its operation. Another initiative taken to reduce GHG emissions was \\nconversion of FO (Furnace Oil) to NG (Natural Gas)- which is a cleaner fuel, in Air heaters. Additionally, NG boiler \\nefficiency improvement and NG usage optimization in coffee process (roasters) was done to further support \\nreduction of emissions. Your Company has also eliminated usage of coal from eight factories.\\n Your Company has taken a significant step towards water conservation projects across all factories reducing \\nthe water withdrawal intensity by ~31% vs 2018 baseline. Key initiatives included expansion of \\\"Zer Eau\\\" project, \\ninitiated in 2014 which focused on reducing water consumption in milk factories by utilizing water embedded in \\nfresh milk, significantly reducing freshwater withdrawal. Nestl\\u00e9 Moga Factory, located in a water-scarce basin, \\nprocesses large volumes of milk daily, generating high effluent. By reusing treated water, the factory aims to \\nreduce groundwater dependence by approximately 25%. Other key water projects that have been executed are \\nincrease of treated effluent recovery by adding an MBR (Membrane Bio-reactor) & RO (Reverse Osmosis) in ETP \\n(Effluent Treatment plant) to recycle & use the water in utilities & increase in recovery of condensate.\\n Your Company is harnessing technology and leveraging digital infrastructure to have strong governance on water \\nconsumption. Over the years, there has been a huge focus on the reuse and recycle of water within factory, for \\ne.g. recycle of water extracted from milk evaporation has helped to reduce ground water consumption. Your \\nCompany has nine factories, and eight factories are zero liquid discharge (ZLD) factories, consuming all the \\ntreated effluent within factory for its need of process or land maintenance.\\n At the factories, there has been continuous efforts to minimize consumption of natural resources and water \\nusage, reduction in energy and CO2 emissions while maximizing production volumes. Over the last 6 years (~2018 \\n- 2024) on an average, for every ton of production, your Company reduced the usage of energy by around 13%, \\nwater usage by around 31%, and specific direct Green House Gas emissions by 70.7%.\\n309\\nAnnual Report 202 4-25 During the period under review, various energy reduction projects were undertaken by the factories of your \\nCompany which will result in substantial annualized savings of approximately 89,000 Gigajoules (\\u201cGJ\\u201d) and \\nexpected to be realized in coming years. Some of the projects undertaken at different factory locations include \\nflash steam heat recovery from condensate; automation of boiler & air heater burners; steam usage optimization \\nin noodle steamers; use of Electronically Commutated (EC+) Blowers in Air Handling Units (AHUs), use of \\nenergy efficient fans for cooling towers, electricity consumption optimization; optimization of compressed air \\nconsumption through leakage arrest.\\n During the period under review, your Company continued to manage water resources by improving efficiencies \\nand helping to restore natural resources by water reduction projects initiated in different factory locations. These \\ninitiatives resulted in reduction in water consumption and reuse of recycled water in a more efficient manner. One \\nof the key initiatives contributing to water savings during the financial year ended 31st March 2025 was increasing \\nthe utilization of treated effluent after polishing through high technology Reverse Osmosis plant. Your Company \\nwill continue to work to achieve good water resources management throughout operations. Your Company is \\nsupporting regenerative farming that aims to improve soil health and soil fertility, as well as protecting water \\nresources and diversity.\\n(b) Additional Investment:\\n Your Company has been making investments over last many years towards water conservation measure, \\nthat achieved significant water savings, totaling 190,000 m3. Some of the proposals, which are initiated for \\nimplementation during the financial year ended 31st March 2025 in different factory locations are as hereunder:\\n\\t Use of biomass fuel for steam generation;\\n\\t Investment in improving plant efficiencies for minimizing water use;\\n\\t Investment in the solar energy by entering into Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA); and \\n\\t Investment in second stage Reverse Osmosis plant to increase water recovery.\\n(c) Impact of the measures at (a) and (b) above for reduction of energy consumption and consequent \\nimpact on the cost of production of goods:\\n During the years, at the factories there have been continuous efforts to improve operational efficiencies, \\nminimizing consumption of natural resources and reducing water, energy and CO2 emissions while maximizing \\nproduction volumes.\\n As a result, during the period under review, the specific GHG emission reduced from 696 Kg CO2 eq per ton to \\n202 Kg CO2 eq per ton (reduction of 70.7%) over 2018 baseline. These GHG emission intensity includes the benefit \\nof purchase of international renewable certificates.\\n Your Company has installed biomass boilers in Moga, Nanjangud and Sanand factories to reduce its operational \\nfootprint and increasingly use renewable fuel in its operation. Another initiative taken to reduce GHG emissions \\nwas conversion of Furnace Oil to Natural Gas - which is a cleaner fuel, in Air heaters. Additionally, NG boiler \\nefficiency improvement and NG usage optimization in coffee process (roasters) was done to further support \\nreduction of emissions.\\n(d) Projects planned or initiated for further improvement in energy and water consumption are: \\nContinuous Energy initiatives in different factory locations:\\n\\t Plant efficiency improvement for generation as well as usage; and\\n\\t Digital tools to optimize chilled water, compressed air, steam consumptions.\\n Continuous Water Initiatives in different factory locations:\\n\\t Investment in second stage Reverse Osmosis plant to increase recovery; and\\n\\t Increase recycling of Effluent Treatment after polishing through RO plant.\\n Continuous Initiatives to reduce GHG emissions in different factory locations:\\n\\t Use of biomass for steam generation.\\n\\t Replace furnace oil with natural gas for air heaters.\\n\\t Replace LPG with NG for boilers & ovens\\n310\\nNestl\\u00e9 India LimitedB.
